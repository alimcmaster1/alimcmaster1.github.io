# React Portfolio (Vite)

This is a modern React-based version of your portfolio site, using Vite, React Router, and CSS Modules.

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```
npm install
   ```
2. **Run the development server**
   ```
npm run dev
   ```
   The site will be available at http://localhost:5173

3. **Build for production**
   ```
npm run build
   ```
   The static site will be output to the `dist` folder.

## Project Structure

If you do not have Node.js locally, you can use this codebase in a cloud IDE (like GitHub Codespaces, StackBlitz, or Gitpod) to run and deploy your site.
