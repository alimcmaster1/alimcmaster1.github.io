## About Me
<div class="pull-left"><img height="15%" width="15%" style="float: left" hspace="15" src="./assets/images/me.jpg"></div>
I'm Alistair - a Data Scientist and Software Engineer. Currently working as a Strategist at Goldman Sachs within the Investment Banking Division. I studied [Astrophysics](https://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/students) at University of Cambridge from 2013-2016.

In my spare time time I enjoy running (half-marathons and [parkrun](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/)), cycling and rock climbing.

I am a significant contributor to the open source data science python stack, mainly [Pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas).
