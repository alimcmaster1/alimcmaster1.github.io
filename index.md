## About Me
I'm Alistair - a Data Scientist and Software Engineer. Currently working as a Strategist at Goldman Sachs
within the Investment Banking Division.

I studied [Astrophysics](https://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/students) at University of Cambridge from 2013-2016.

In my spare time time I enjoy running (half-marathons and [parkrun](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/)), cycling and rock climbing.
